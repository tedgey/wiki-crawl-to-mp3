Notes and scribbles on how to make this thing work.

1. go to grabData.spec.js and adjust the "names" array to include the names of the files you want to crawl.
    This will automatically download the files into the scraped_articles folder. 
2. npm start to start the server
3. run the mocha test to scrape the data (in UI or in terminal)

    ```npm test```

This will generate text, create tts mp3s of the text, and snag 10 images of each person listed."
